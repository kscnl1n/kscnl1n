Hello, my name is Kaylee, I am a software engineer and quantum computing afficionado and this is my portfolio.

Please take a look around :)


**Current Projects**

**Air-Fair** 
Began work on 05/01/2024. Web application dedicated to tracking the cheapest flight options worldwide. Hosted on Heroku!**

**Melodex** 
Began work on 10/01/2023. Web application that uses Node.JS and a RESTful framework for storing data. Uses Spotify API and MusicBrainz' database for metadata, and Pytorch/Python for the AI functions. **Can be found under kscnl1n/Melodex.**

**Fundamentals of Linear Algebra in Machine Learning**
Began work on 12/01/2024. This is a course designed to teach beginners to ML models the basics of Python and Tensorflow, as well as the math-skeptic csoftware engineer the importance of linear algebra and advanced calculus in ML models. 


**Past Projects**

**AeroExpress** - Began work on 02/10/2024. Website for PROS' challenge in the University of Houston Hackathon, meant to track flights around the user and return the cheapest options after being prompted in natural language. Uses Amadeus API for flight and pricing information and Google API for NLP.

**PyFig** - Began work on 03/17/2023. Simple Python compiler using TKinter for GUI.

**PyRegress** - Began work on 05/31/2023. Regression calculator built in Python meant to display future values for datasets in Matlab. 

**vqe** - Final for Qubit x Qubit computational physics workshop course. Implementation of the hybrid quantum algorithm VQE for calculating the ground state of the transverse Ising model.
